## Bomberman

This project is an alternative to one of the most popular games which named Bomberman. This game creates a small platform which 2 bombers have to reach and kill each other with the help of their bombs. Players have to break the walls to reach the opposing player and there is a small chance to spawn a powerup that helps player to achieve their goal with each broken wall. To kill the opposing bomberman, players should use a proper strategy and hit with their bombs' explosive area of effect. However, players also need to be cautios about their own bombs because every bomb can kill every player no matter whose bomb it is. The last player alive will win the game. :boom:
